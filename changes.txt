Changes to the codemirror 0.93 core for context saving

Please use your favorite diff tool to see the changes. There are many, and
they are difficult to list here one by one.

Included in the CodeMirror-0.93 directory are the original files for
editor.js and select.js as editor.js.orig and select.js.orig so you can make
a diff on those files. On Linux or OSX you can perform:

# diff CodeMirror-0.93/js/editor.js CodeMirror-0.93/js/editor.js.orig
# diff CodeMirror-0.93/js/select.js CodeMirror-0.93/js/select.js.orig

To view changes made on the original sources.
