 Common Sense Code Completion Enhancements
 
 This is a repository based on Q42 Internet B.V. tool for code completion
 on CodeMirror.
 
 Some fixes are usable only on Webpop, those enhancements are on the "webpop"
 branch. Standard code is in master, so you only have to clone the repository
 and you're almost set.
